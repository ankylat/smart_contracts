## AnkyAirdrop.sol

On anky.lat, as soon as a user logs in with their account, they need to be airdropped an Anky. This Anky will be the keeper of all the notebooks that the user is going to write on in the future.

Each user will have only one Anky, and the idea is that they can transfer it to their loved ones when she dies. How to design this is a challenge.

## AnkyNotebooks.sol

Users will be able to create notebooks, which are templates for coming to write on a set amount of days.

If a user wants to write on one of those notebooks, she has to mint it. The minting process will be paid with credit card, and part of the revenue of the notebook will be redirected to the Anky of the user so that she has credit for spending inside the anky app.
